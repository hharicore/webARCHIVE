        Weaver and conduit for prophetic images. This web is woven in textiles of attributes, tags, script, and most importantly, images. These images move sometimes and sometimes they are accompanied by sounds. Importantly, either these images move in sequence for you, or (in meatspace) your position relative to the source of images dictates the order in which the information is rendered. 

            <p class="top__text">
              I reside and operate on unceded lands belonging the Woi Wurrung and Boon Wurrung people of the Kulin Nation. They are the owners of these lands, and have been so for countless generations. I pay my respects to Elders past and present, and extend this respect to any First Nations visitors to this website. Sovereignty has never been ceded.
